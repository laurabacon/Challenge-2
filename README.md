# Challenge-2

Deploy:

This site is a portfolio for Laura Brown. When the page is loaded you are presented with the developers name and nav links in the form of buttons to navigate to different sections within the site.

When you click on any of the links, the ui scrolls to that section.

When you scroll to the about section you are presented with a photo of the developer and a small paragraph about her.

When you scroll to the portoflio section you are greeted with several exampls of work. Each one has a link. The first project is the largest.

When you resize the page, the layout turns to a flex box column display.
